I started working on a GUI for our project. This will be needed to collect the information on how to run our device, such information may include the frequency of data collection and so on.

I am still working on what particular bits of information I need to collect from the user. And what format the device itself will accept it in.

There are a few considerations for the platform that will run this application. Such as Java or React. For React I will need a backend to allow the user to download that config file some how.

The GUI is needed to setup the device that suits the users particular needs.

So further research is needed to find out what framework and language to use and the finicky part of creating a JSON or a TXT file that can be fed to the device.

Decided to go with Java Swing framework for the GUI, since the Javascript approach would mean that I would need some sort of backend implementation. Currently working to try and create a sample executable to run on my Mac. Unfortunately, I am wrestling with some problems that cause the app to not open at all. The list of parameters needed to be put into a text file will be clarified later. So for now I will try and get a template GUI working and then I can fill it in with relevant information.

Having gone through the notes and the feedback from the professor about our presentation for the prototype, Brian and I wrote the test report. It inluded the conclusions about the things that worked as desired and the other aspects of the prototype that did not work so well. We established the next steps that need to be accomplished in order to make the device fully functional. The GUI is nearly ready. After we can get the SD card working, I can test the GUI to see if the text file it produces is compatible with the machine.
