The GUI is almost finished. Need to implement better graphics and visuals. The program outputs a txt file with the inputs converted to text. Still trying to figure out the best parameters to collect from the user. Cannot yet test if the txt file is read by the machine, I think it is a problem with the spacing.

Ran into an issue with the GUI. Could not complile the program into an executable. Still trying to figure out what the issue is. This is a small drawback. So now thinking of switching the framework to implement the GUI. Because it is very tedious to create good visuals in plain Java. I am thinking of switching to Javascript and building a website instead of an executable. The visuals with React are much easier. Started to implement the web application.

The React App is finished. Now I need to format the txt file in a JSON format for the device to understand the settings that the user wants to set up.

The format seems to be the right one, now I need to confirm that the file works on the machine. Will meet up with whoever has the product to test the text file or i will send it to them.
